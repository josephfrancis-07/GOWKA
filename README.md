# Omni food

##A web page built using HTML5 and CSS3



The projectâ€™s main idea is to resolve the problem of food wastage at special occasions, parties and restaurants by efficiently distributing them to the needy(orphanages, hospitals, old-age homes and slums) through a website and well-framed network. The website connects party holders to the superintendents of orphanages and social workers.
